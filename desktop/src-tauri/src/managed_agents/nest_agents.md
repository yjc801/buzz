# Buzz Nest

Your persistent workspace. Created once by the Buzz desktop app. The static content above the managed-section markers is regenerated on upgrades — add custom notes below the markers or in separate files.

## Directory Layout

| Dir | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `GUIDES/` | Actionable runbooks synthesized from research |
| `PLANS/` | Planning documents for work in progress |
| `RESEARCH/` | Findings, notes, and reference material |
| `WORK_LOGS/` | Session logs — what was tried, learned, decided |
| `OUTBOX/` | Shareable docs for external readers (no frontmatter) |
| `REPOS/` | Source checkouts. Work in an existing local checkout when one exists; clone here only when none does |
| `.scratch/` | Temporary working files — treat as disposable between sessions |

Filenames: `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` (e.g., `OAUTH_FLOW_NOTES.md`).

The bundled CLI is your primary tool interface — run its `--help` command for usage. The CLI skill file has the full reference.

## Checking Out a Branch or PR

**Reuse a checkout path; don't mint one per PR.** A fresh clone or `git worktree add` at a *new* path is a cold Rust environment, not just a cold `target/`. Two reasons, and sharing a `target/` only fixes the second:

- Hermit pins `CARGO_HOME` inside whichever directory it is activated in, so a new path re-downloads the whole registry (~800 crates, ~800 MB).
- Cargo keys a local crate's artifacts on its **absolute path**, so a new path recompiles every workspace crate even against a shared `target/`.

Measured on a sprite: ~4 GB and a full cold build per throwaway checkout, thrown away when the PR was done.

So `git fetch` and `git checkout` an existing checkout instead of creating another one. Where `buzz-workspace` is on your PATH (remote agents), let it pick the checkout for you:

```bash
cd "$(buzz-workspace pr/19)"      # a PR, by number
cd "$(buzz-workspace main)"       # a branch, tag, or sha
buzz-workspace list               # which slots hold what
```

It recycles a small pool of fixed-path slots against a shared cargo cache, never touches `target/`, and will not recycle a slot that has uncommitted work.

## Knowledge File Conventions

Files in `GUIDES/`, `PLANS/`, `RESEARCH/`, `WORK_LOGS/` should include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Always Quoted Title"
tags: [lowercase-hyphenated]
status: active
created: 2026-01-15
---
```

**Status values:** `active` | `superseded` | `stale` | `draft`

> ⚠️ Title **must** be quoted — unquoted colons can break YAML parsing.

## Core Guidelines

- **Local first** — check `RESEARCH/`, `GUIDES/`, `PLANS/` before external searches
- **Write findings down** — if you research something, save it to `RESEARCH/`
- **Cite sources** — no claim without a path, link, or reference
- **Don't overwrite** — append or create new files; don't silently clobber existing work
- **`.scratch/` is disposable** — don't rely on it across sessions
- **Stay on task** — only stage files relevant to your current work

## Git Commit Identity

The human operator signs off for accountability.

- **Human sign-off (required):** every commit MUST include a `Signed-off-by` trailer for the human operator who is responsible for the agent's work. Add via `git commit --trailer "Signed-off-by: Human Name <human@email>"`. One blank line must separate trailers from the commit body.
- **Human credit (`Co-authored-by`):** every commit MUST also include a `Co-authored-by` trailer for the same human operator, with identical name and email to the `Signed-off-by` line. GitHub parses `Co-authored-by` for contribution-graph credit; `Signed-off-by` alone does not grant it. Add via `git commit --trailer "Co-authored-by: Human Name <human@email>"`. Place `Co-authored-by` before `Signed-off-by` in the trailer block.
- **Discovering the human's identity:** read `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` from the working repository. These reflect the human operator's configured identity for that repo (which may differ from their global config). Use these exact values for both trailers. Do NOT hardcode, guess, or prompt for the email — the repo config is the source of truth. If `git config user.email` returns empty, STOP and ask the human operator for their name and email before committing.
- **Signing:** if the agent has a registered signing key, sign commits. If not, commits will land unverified — this is acceptable until agent SSH keys are provisioned. Do NOT use the human's signing key.
- **Verify before pushing:** `git log -1` should show the human's `Signed-off-by` trailer.
