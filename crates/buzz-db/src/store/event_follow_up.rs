//! App-owned follow-up work for a newly inserted `events` row.
//!
//! Two pieces of work follow every durable event insert:
//!
//! - **Push match enqueue.** Push-eligible kinds get a `push_match_queue` row
//!   when the community has an eligible lease. This runs right after the
//!   INSERT, in the same transaction, and any failure rejects the event.
//! - **Channel TTL refresh.** A channel-scoped event pushes its ephemeral
//!   channel's `ttl_deadline` forward. [`AdmittedTx`] records the channel and
//!   runs the refresh as the last statement before COMMIT (see
//!   [`refresh_channel_ttls`]). A refresh failure is logged and counted, and
//!   the event still commits.
//!
//! This is the application-side replacement for the `events_enqueue_push_match`
//! and `events_refresh_channel_ttl` triggers (migrations 0023, 0024, 0040).
//! Both run during the migration window; the push enqueue is idempotent
//! (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and a second TTL refresh is harmless. Every
//! production `INSERT INTO events` must call this module, which
//! `tests/observability_source.rs` enforces.
