-- Replica-fence floor guard (keep in sync with migrations/0021). A deferred
-- constraint trigger re-checks, inside COMMIT processing, that channel-bearing
-- event rows are no older than `buzz.created_at_floor` seconds before commit
-- time (clock_timestamp(), NOT the transaction-frozen now()). This turns the
-- relay's ingest-time created_at envelope into a commit-time storage
-- invariant, which is what lets keyset-cursor pages below the replica fence
-- be served by a read replica without holes. Enforcement is armed per session
-- via the GUC (set by the relay's writer pool on connect); sessions without
-- the GUC (pg_restore, manual backfills) bypass it and must hold the replica
-- fence closed for their duration. The only structural exemption is
-- channel_id IS NULL: those rows never appear in keyset-paged windows.
